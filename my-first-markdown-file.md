# Hello Markdown
It is __so__ nice to be able to write in this simple **format**
Once you get a *hang* of it you just:
    
    *Remember the basic syntax
    *Write your doc
    *Done!
 
Now you can be a Wiz at this language and code stuff like 'Console.WriteLine("Hello World")'
If you forget, don't worry.
